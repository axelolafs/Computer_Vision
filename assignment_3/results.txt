With an image size of 320, I achieved a framerate of about 4-5 FPS, with the tiny image I got around 15 FPS.

I then did a test for recall, where I placed Scissors in the scene and moved them around, I measured 200 frames where they were correctly identified,
over 230 frames thus a recall of 200/230 = 87%
Then I did a different test for precision and moved my hands in the scene and counted the frames in which something else than a person was identified,
I counted for 50 frames my hands were identified as something else than hands and for 168 frames they were correctly identified as a person,
thus a precision of 168/(168+50) = 77%
