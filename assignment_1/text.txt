    The processing time for one video frame or image.
        The FPS was very varied but was floating around 30-50~

    How does the processing time change when you add the bright spot detection?
        I did not note any differences, although that might be easier if I had implemented a running average for the FPS counter

    Is the processing time identical when you do not display the image?


    How does your for-loop implementation compare to the built-in function?
        It was notably slower, seemed to have around 20 FPS

    Moving your hand in front of the camera, estimate the latency between image capture and display.
        250-500 ms maybe?

    Is the latency different when capturing from a mobile phone?
